        "c. The mutual force of attraction between an apple and the earth is equal and opposite, but the apple falls down to the earth and the earth appears to be at rest. Why?",
        "This is because the mass of apple is much smaller than mass of earth due to this, the force can produce the motion on apple not on the earth.",
        "d. One can jump 6 times higher on moon on earth. Why?",
        "The mass of the moon is much smaller than mass of earth that acceleration due to gravity on moon is only 1/6th of that of the earth. Because of this lower value of ‘g’, one can jump 6 times higher on moon than on earth.",

        "The plants and animals that Lived many years ago were sedimented on the base of ocean due to various geological causes. The millions of layers were formed in millions of years which causes high pressure and temperature in lower layers. Those pressure and temperature causes chemical change in them that formed dense and dark liquid that mainly contain hydrocarbons. This is called mineral oil. In this way, it is formed.",
